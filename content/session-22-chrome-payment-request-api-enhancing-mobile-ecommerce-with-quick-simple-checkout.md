SC seeks opportunities with his clients in order to improve web performance and mobile experience for his clients' projects, in the same time experimenting with new technologies around the web.

According to studies, 66% of mobile purchases are made through websites rather than apps? More saddening is the conversion rate on mobile websites is only 33% of that on desktop. And dealing web payment is big challenge and dilemma for developers as well.

Payment Request API is built with latest Chrome with native UI and easy-going flow for helping collect user's info to be processed in payment gateway.
