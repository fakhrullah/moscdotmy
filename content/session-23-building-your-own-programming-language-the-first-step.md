Have you ever thinking, how the computer can understand and execute command we gave them ? How to build the magic instructions that computer can understand ?

Most programming language today are based on English. What if you can instruct computer to do thing in any language that you wish, like in Malay, Mandarin, Arabic or whatever your favorite spoken language ?

You can do it if you know how to build your own programming language. Even the language you build end up not being used by anyone, or lacking a lot of features to being practical, you still learn a great deal of thing that will make you into better programmer or computer user.

Throughout this talk, I'll try to walk the audience to their first step in building their own programming language. We will learn different kind of programming language we can build, what is compiler and interpreter and how building it is just an exercise of mapping one word to another word. In the end, the objective is for you to know how to start and where to look for resources that you need in your journey to build your own programming language.
