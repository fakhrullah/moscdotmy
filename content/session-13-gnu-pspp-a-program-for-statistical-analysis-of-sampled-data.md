Session 13 : GNU PSPP. A program for statistical analysis of sampled data

PSPP is a stable and reliable application. It can perform descriptive statistics, T-tests, anova, linear and logistic regression, measures of association, cluster analysis, reliability and factor analysis, non-parametric tests and more. Its backend is designed to perform its analyses as fast as possible, regardless of the size of the input data. You can use PSPP with its graphical interface or the more traditional syntax commands. The best things are it's Free, Opensource (GNU) and No license fees. No expiration period.

Recommended to all researchers especially postgraduates who are looking for low cost software utilization.
