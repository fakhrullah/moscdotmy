<div style="text-align: justify;">System administration is a wide ranged area which caters infrastructure handling , log analysis, security aware practice and common sense. Open source based tools are possibly among the favorite choice due to the nature of the openness. My talk will cover from the basic to intermediate level use of the open source tools in the area of system administration which could possibly save our time in dealing with the routine task. For example the use of Ansible for the configuration management tool, tmux/screen use and git.  </div>
