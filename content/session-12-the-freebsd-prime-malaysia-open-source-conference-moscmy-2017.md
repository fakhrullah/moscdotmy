Session 12 : The FreeBSD - Prime

As a developer, Sysadmin and sometimes a day to day user we come up with the words Linux and Unix. Unfortunately, although we will find a handful of Open Source Linux OS it is hard to find a true UNIX derivative in the Open Source arena. Till today the only fully open source UNIX derivative remaining is the *BSD or Berkley System Development.

It highly differs in structure, stability and philosophy compared to another Linux OS. This presentation briefly tries to explain about the history of BSD systems, structure, features and usage in our day to day life. Additionally, although starting with generic BSD family we will more likely be emphasizing on The FreeBSD Project.
