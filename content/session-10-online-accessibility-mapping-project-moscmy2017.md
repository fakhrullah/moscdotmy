<div style="text-align: justify;">Session 10 : Online Accessibility Mapping Project</div>

<div style="text-align: justify;">A session at Malaysia Open Source Conference 2017 (MOSCMY 2017)</div>


<div>Thursday 18th May, 2017 12:00pm to 12:45pm (SMT)</div>


<div style="text-align: justify;">Challenges Foundation will run a project to make cycling accessible for children and persons with disabilities. The Challenges Tandem Cycle 4 Change Project will be launched in 2017 with a  National Recycle Bicycle campaign to collect used and abandoned bicycles in the community to be recycled into our tandem bicycles.</div>

<div style="text-align: justify;">One activity of this project involves street mapping for location of abandoned bicycles as well as donated bicycles from public. We hope to use OpenStreetMap,  for this project to get public to pin the location of these bicycles and we can then send volunteers to collect them when we see a cluster of pins.</div>

<div style="text-align: justify;">The other use of the street mapping will be to map accessible cycling spots that are also safe for us to organise cycling trips for youth and children with disabilities. I hope to start this project in April and hopefully by May we would be able to report some success or progress. If not , I see the presentation as an opportunity to initiate a Call for Action to delegates at this conference to help us move this project forward</div>
