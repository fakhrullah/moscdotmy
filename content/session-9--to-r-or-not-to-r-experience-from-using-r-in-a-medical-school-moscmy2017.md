<div style="text-align: justify;">R is a freely available language and environment for statistical computing and graphics. It has over 10200 packages to cater for the needs of statisticians, data scientists, epidemiologists, ecologists, econometricians and many more people.</div>

<div style="text-align: justify;">At the School of Medical Sciences, Universiti Sains Malaysia, we informally introduced R in late 2013 and formally integrated R into our academic syllabus in 2015\. We use RStudio as the IDE for R though Revolution R is another popular IDE. In the statistic class, we teach students to read data, perform statistical analysis and produce reports in R.</div>

<div style="text-align: justify;">Using R makes learning more exciting and using R-markdown helps students produce nice reports. Our experience shows R requires steeper learning curve but the challenge and the versatility of R make the students more engaged and the learning more effective. We feel that academicians should promote the use of R in their classes.</div>
